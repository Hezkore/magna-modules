# MagnaLib
MagnaLib helps you quickly get started with developing your next [BlitzMax NG](https://blitzmax.org/) application.

## Features
* No external dependencies, only base [BlitzMax NG](https://blitzmax.org/) modules are used
* Comes as multiple modules, use them all or pick only the ones you need
* Doesn't rely on any graphics engine, use it with [Max2D](https://blitzmax.org/docs/en/api/brl/brl.max2d/), [Raylib](https://github.com/bmx-ng/ray.mod) or anything else
* Free and open source

## Modules
* [magna.config](/config.mod) - Load Magna configuration files using reflection
* [magna.layout](/layout.mod) - Magna layout generator
* [magna.network](/network.mod) - Magna TCP server and client

## Installation
Git clone to your [BlitzMax NG](https://blitzmax.org/) `/mod/magna.mod/` folder.

If you instead use GitHub's "Download Zip"; remember that the default name is "magnalib-master"\
_WHICH IS NOT CORRECT_!\
Rename to `magna.mod` once extracted.

The correct path for this readme file should be `/mod/magna.mod/README.md`
