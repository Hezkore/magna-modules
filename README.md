MagnaLib helps you quickly get started with developing your next BlitzMax NG application.

---

### Features
--------
* No external dependencies, only base BlitzMax NG modules are used
* Comes as multiple modules, use them all or pick only the ones you need
* Doesn't rely on any graphics engine, use it with Max2D, Raylib or anything else
* Free and open source

### Installation
--------
Git clone to your BlitzMax NG `/mod/magna.mod/` folder.

If you instead use GitHub's "Download Zip"; remember that the default name is "magnalib-master" _WHICH IS NOT CORRECT_!\
Rename to `magna.mod` once extracted.

The correct path for this readme file should be `/mod/magna.mod/README.md`
